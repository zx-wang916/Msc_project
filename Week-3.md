# Preparation

## What I've Done

- [ ] Try with 1D/2D process model with MATLAB
  - [ ] 1D Static Object
  - [ ] 2D dynamic
- [ ] Explore using example code for workshop topic2-part2
- [ ] New Paper "A Comparison of Graph Optimization Approaches for Pose Estimation in SLAM"
  - This paper describe least squares minimisation methods, e.g., g2o, Ceres, GTSAM and SE-Sync.
  - Evaluate them on an array of publicly available synthetic and real-world pose graph datasets.
