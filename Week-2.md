# Preparation

## What I've Done

- [ ]  Read through two papers
  - [ ]  Weak in the NEES?: Auto-tuning Kalman Filters with Bayesian Optimization
  - [ ]  Proposition 3 and 4 in Reliable Graphs for SLAM
- [ ]  Workshop code for starting point
  - [ ]  Try different estimation algorithms
- [ ]  Fill in the Project Plan form. [As recommended by Simon]

## Problems

I have read the literature entitled "*Weak in the NEES?: Auto-tuning Kalman Filters with Bayesian Optimization*" and it mentioned the use of the *BayesOpt* library. I was wondering if this library would be beneficial for my project. Unfortunately, the link provided in the paper to the *BayesOpt* library is not working for me. However, I found a GitHub repository for the library at the following address:

â€‹	[https://github.com/rmcantin/bayesopt](https://github.com/rmcantin/bayesopt)

It would be greatly appreciated if you could share the code used for the numerical examples (Section IV) in "*Weak in the NEES?: Auto-tuning Kalman Filters with Bayesian Optimization*."

## Meeting

try with 1D 2D process model : beam 
	- with ground truth

Example code in github
